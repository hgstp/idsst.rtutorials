## Welcome

In this tutorial, you will explore the popularity of different names over time. To succeed, you will need to master the following tool for manipulating data with R:

* tibbles and `View()`, which let you inspect raw data

In this tutorial, we'll use a dataset named `babynames`, which comes in a package that is also named `babynames`. Within `babynames`, you will find information about almost every name given to children in the United States since 1880. 

This tutorial introduces `babynames` and a new data structure that makes working with data in R easy: the tibble.

In addition to `babynames`, this tutorial uses the [core tidyverse packages](http://tidyverse.org/), including ggplot2, tibble, and dplyr. All of these packages have been pre-installed for your convenience. But they haven't been pre-loaded.

### Loading babynames

Before we begin, let's learn a little about our data. The `babynames` dataset comes in the **babynames** package. The package is defined as a dependency for `idsst.rtutorials` and was installed together with `idsst.rtutorials`. But I have not pre-_loaded_ babynames, or any other package for this tutorial.

What does this mean? In R, whenever you want to use a package that is not part of base R, you need to load the package with the command `library()`. Until you load a package, R cannot find the datasets and functions contained in the package. For example, if we asked R to display the `babynames` dataset, which comes in the babynames package, right now, we'd get the message below. R cannot find the dataset because we haven't loaded the babynames package.

```{r error = TRUE}
babynames
```

To load the `babynames` package, you would run the command `library(babynames)`. After you load a package, R will be able to find its contents _until you close R_. The next time you open R, you will need to reload the package if you wish to use it again.

This might sound inconvenient, but choosing which packages to load keeps your R experience simple and orderly.

In the chunk below, load babynames (the package) and then open the help page for `babynames` (the data set). Be sure to read the help page before going on.

```{r babynames-1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "bnames"}

```

```{r babynames-1-solution}
library(babynames)
?babynames
```

```{r bnames, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(babynames)
```

### The data

Now that you know a little about the dataset, let's examine its contents. If you were to run `babynames` at your R console, you would get output that looks like this:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
babynames

#> 187     1880   F       Christina    65 6.659495e-04
#> 188     1880   F           Lelia    65 6.659495e-04
#> 189     1880   F           Nelle    65 6.659495e-04
#> 190     1880   F             Sue    65 6.659495e-04
#> 191     1880   F         Johanna    64 6.557041e-04
#> 192     1880   F           Lilly    64 6.557041e-04
#> 193     1880   F         Lucinda    63 6.454587e-04
#> 194     1880   F         Minerva    63 6.454587e-04
#> 195     1880   F          Lettie    62 6.352134e-04
#> 196     1880   F           Roxie    62 6.352134e-04
#> 197     1880   F         Cynthia    61 6.249680e-04
#> 198     1880   F          Helena    60 6.147226e-04
#> 199     1880   F           Hilda    60 6.147226e-04
#> 200     1880   F           Hulda    60 6.147226e-04
#>  [ reached getOption("max.print") -- omitted 1825233 rows ]
```

Yikes. What is happening?

### Displaying large data

`babynames` is a large data frame, and R is not well equipped to display the contents of large data frames. R shows as many rows as possible before your memory buffer is overwhelmed. At that point, R stops, leaving you to look at an arbitrary section of your data.

You can avoid this behavior by transforming your data frame to a _tibble_. 

## tibbles

### What is a tibble?

A tibble is a special type of table. R displays tibbles in a refined way whenever you have the **tibble** package loaded: R will print only the first ten rows of a tibble and all of the columns that fit into your console window. R also adds valuable summary information about the tibble, such as the data types of each column and the size of the data set. 

Whenever you do not have the tibble packages loaded, R will display the tibble as a data frame. In fact, tibbles _are_ data frames, an enhanced type of data frame.

You can think of the difference between the data frame display and the tibble display like this:

```{r out.width = "90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tibble_display.png")
```

### as_tibble()

You can transform a data frame to a tibble with the `as_tibble()` function in the tibble package, e.g. `as_tibble(cars)`. However, `babynames` is already a tibble. To display it nicely, you just need to load the tibble package. 

To see what I mean, use `library()` to load the tibble package in the chunk below and then call `babynames`.

```{r babynames-3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "bnames"}

```

```{r babynames-3-solution}
library(tibble)
babynames
```

```{r babynames-3-check}
"Excellent! If you want to check whether or not an object is a tibble, you can use the `is_tibble()` function that comes in the tibble package. For example, this would return TRUE: `is_tibble(babynames)`."
```

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tibble)
```

You do not need to worry much about tibbles in these tutorials; we will automatically convert each data frame into an interactive table in future tutorials. However, you should consider making tibbles an important part of your work in R.

### View()

What if you'd like to inspect the remaining portions of a tibble? To see the entire tibble, use the `View()` command. R will launch a window that shows a scrollable display of the entire data set. For example, the code below will launch a data viewer in the RStudio IDE.

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
View(babynames)
```

`View()` works in conjunction with the software (like RStudio) you run R from: `View()` opens the data editor provided by that software. Unfortunately, this tutorial doesn't come with a data editor, so you won't be able to use `View()` today (unless you open the RStudio IDE, for example, and run the code there).

### Recap

Tibbles are a tool that makes life with R easier. Ironically, you may not immediately appreciate their value: these tutorials wrap data frames into an interactive table for display. However, you will want to utilize tibbles and the tidyverse package when you move out of the tutorials and begin working with R inside the RStudio IDE.

This tutorial also introduced the babynames dataset. In the tutorials on data wrangling, you will use this data set to plot the popularity of _your_ name over time. Along the way, you will learn how to filter and subset data sets in R.
