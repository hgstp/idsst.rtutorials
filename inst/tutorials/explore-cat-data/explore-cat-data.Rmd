## Welcome

This tutorial will show you how to make **bar charts** and use them to explore the distribution of categorical data. You will learn how to:

* make and interpret bar charts
* customize bar charts with **aesthetics** and **parameters**
* use **position adjustments**
* use **facets** to create subplots

In addition, the tutorial discusses how to compute the frequency distribution of a categorical variable.



The tutorial is adapted from _R for Data Science_ by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund, published by O’Reilly Media, Inc., 2016, ISBN: 9781491910399. You can purchase the book at [shop.oreilly.com](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034407.do).

The tutorial uses the `ggplot2` and `dplyr` packages. Click the Next Topic button to begin.

## Diamonds data

For this tutorial, we will use the `diamonds` dataset found in the `ggplot2` package. The dataset contains the prices and other attributes of almost 54,000 diamonds. 

```{r}
diamonds
```

The variables are as follows:


+ `carat`: weight of the diamond (0.2–5.01)

+ `cut`: quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)

+ `color`: diamond colour, from D (best) to J (worst)

+ `clarity`: measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))

+ `depth`: total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43–79)

+ `table`: width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43–95)

+ `price`: given in US dollars ($326–$18,823)

+ `x`: length in mm (0–10.74)

+ `y`: width in mm (0–58.9)

+ `z`: depth in mm (0–31.8)


## Bar Charts

### How to make a bar chart

To make a bar chart with ggplot2, we have to use `geom_bar()`. For example, the code below plots a bar chart of the `cut` variable in the `diamonds` dataset, which comes with ggplot2. 

```{r out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```

### The y axis

When using `geom_bar()`, you should not provide a $y$ aesthetic. Instead, ggplot2 will automatically count how many times each $x$ value occurs in the data and present those counts on the $y$ axis. For instance, the plot above illustrates that there are over 20,000 diamonds in the dataset with a value of `Ideal`.

You can compute this information manually with the `count()` function from the dplyr package.

```{r}
diamonds |> 
  count(cut)
```

### geom_col()

Sometimes, you may want to map the heights of the bars not to counts, but to a variable in the data set. To do this, use `geom_col()`, which is short for column. 

```{r out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(data = pressure) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = temperature, y = pressure))
```

When you use `geom_col()`, your $x$ and $y$ values should have a one to one relationship, as they do in the `pressure` data set.


### Exercise 1 - Make a bar chart

Use the code chunk below to plot the distribution of the `color` variable in the `diamonds` data set.

```{r r1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r r1-solution}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color))
```

### Exercise 2 - Interpretation

```{r out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut)) + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of diamond cuts")
```

```{r r2, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Bar charts",
  question("What is the most common type of cut in the `diamonds` dataset?",
           answer("Fair"),
           answer("Good"),
           answer("Very Good"),
           answer("Premium"),
           answer("Ideal", correct = TRUE),
           allow_retry = TRUE
  ),    
  question("How many diamonds in the dataset had a `Good` cut?",
           answer("~2000"),
           answer("~5000", correct = TRUE),
           answer("~7000"),
           answer("~20000"),
           allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```


### Exercise 3 - count() and col()

Recreate the bar graph of `color` from exercise one, but this time first use `count()` to manually compute the heights of the bars. Then use `geom_col()` to plot the results as a bar graph. Does your graph look the same as in exercise one?

```{r r4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r r4-solution}
diamonds |>
  count(color) |> 
  ggplot() +
    geom_col(mapping = aes(x = color, y = n))
```

##  Aesthetics

### Aesthetics for bars

`geom_bar()` and `geom_col()` can use several aesthetics:

* alpha
* color
* fill
* linetype
* linewidth

One of these, color, creates the most surprising results. Predict what the code below will return and then run it.

```{r color, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, color = cut))
```

### fill

The color aesthetic controls the outline of each bar in your bar plot, which may not be what you want. To color the interior of each bar, use the `fill` aesthetic:

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="50%"}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, color = cut), linewidth = 1) + 
  labs(title = "color = cut")

ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = cut)) + 
  labs(title = "fill = cut")
```

Use the code chunk below to experiment with fill, along with other `geom_bar()` aesthetics, like alpha, linetype, and linewidth.

```{r color2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, color = cut))
```

### Width

You can control the width of each bar in your bar chart with the `width` parameter. In the chunk below, set `width = 1`, then `width = 0.5`. Can you spot the difference?

```{r width, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = cut), width = 0.9)
```

Notice that width is a _setting_, not an aesthetic mapping. Hence, you should set width _outside_ of the `aes()` function.

### Exercise 4 - aesthetics

Create a colored bar chart of the `clarity` variable. Map the interior color of each bar to `clarity`.

```{r r5, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r r5-solution}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = clarity, fill = clarity))
```

## Position adjustments

### Positions

If you map `fill` to a new variable, `geom_bar()` will display a _stacked_ bar chart:

```{r out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity))
```

This plot displays 40 different combinations of `cut` and `clarity`, each displayed by its own rectangle. `geom_bar()` lays out the rectangles by stacking rectangles that have the same `cut` value on top of one another. You can change this behavior with a _position adjustment_.

### Position = "dodge"

To place rectangles that have the same `cut` value beside each other, set `position = "dodge"`.

```{r out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "dodge")
```

This plot shows the same rectangles as the previous chart; however, it lays out rectangles that have the same `cut` value _beside_ each other.

### Position = "stack"

To create the familiar stacked bar chart, set `position = "stack"` (which is the default for `geom_bar()`).

```{r out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "stack")
```

### Position = "fill"

To expand each bar to take up the entire $y$ axis, set `position = "fill"`. ggplot2 will stack the rectangles and then scale them within each bar.

```{r out.width = "80%"}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "fill")
```

This makes it easy to _compare proportions_. For example, you can scan across the bars to see how the proportion of `IF` diamonds changes from cut to cut. 

### What is a position adjustment?

Every geom function in ggplot2 takes a `position` argument that is preset to a reasonable default. You can use `position` to determine how a geom should adjust objects that would otherwise overlap with each other. 

For example, in our plot, each value of `cut` is associated with eight rectangles: one each for `I1`, `SI2`, `SI1`, `VS2`, `VS1`, `VVS2`, `VVS1`, and `IF`. Each of these eight rectangles deserves to go in the same place: directly above the value of `cut` that it is associated with, with the bottom of the rectangle placed at count = 0. But if we plotted the plot like that, the rectangles would overlap each other.

Here's what that would look like if you could peek around the side of the graph.

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/positions.png")
```

### Position = "identity"

..and here's what that would look like if you could see the graph from the front. You can make this plot by setting `position = "identity"`. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "identity")
```

Position adjustments tell ggplot2 how to re-distribute objects when they overlap. `position = "identity"` is the "adjustment" that let's objects overlap each other. It is a bad choice for bar graphs because the result looks like a stacked bar chart, even though it is not. 

### Exercise 5 - Positions

Use the code chunk to recreate the plot you see below. Remember: `color` is the name of a variable in `diamonds` (not to be confused with an aesthetic).

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color, fill = clarity), position = "fill", width = 1)
```

```{r r6, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r r6-solution}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color, fill = clarity), position = "fill", width = 1)
```

### Exercise 6 - Positions

Use the code chunk to recreate the plot you see below. Remember: `color` is the name of a variable in `diamonds` (not to be confused with an aesthetic).

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color, fill = cut), position = "dodge")
```

```{r r7, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r r7-solution}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color, fill = cut), position = "dodge")
```

### Exercise 7 - position = "identity"

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = color), position = "identity")
```

```{r q8, echo = FALSE}
quiz(caption = 'Why is position = "identity" a bad idea?',
     question('Suppose the graph above uses position = "stack". About how many diamonds have an ideal cut and a G color?',
              answer("5000", message = 'This would be true if the graph uses `position = "identity"`. Can you tell why?'),
              answer("3000"),
              answer("1800", correct = TRUE, message = "In a stacked bar chart, you can calculate the number of observations in each bar by subtracting the y value at the bottom of the bar from the y value at the top."),
              answer("The graph doesn't contain enough information to make an estimate."),
              allow_retry = TRUE),
     question('Suppose the graph above uses position = "identity". About how many diamonds have an ideal cut and a G color?',
              answer("5000", correct = TRUE, message = "Here the green bar extends all the way from 5000 to 0; most of the bar is behind the blue, purple, and magenta bars. In practice, you would never construct a bar chart like this."),
              answer("3000"),
              answer("1800", message = 'This would be true if the graph uses `position = "fill"`. Can you tell why?'),
              answer("The graph doesn't contain enough information to make an estimate."),
              allow_retry = TRUE)
)
```

## Facets

### Facetting

You can more easily compare subgroups of data if you place each subgroup in its own subplot, a process known as **facetting.**

```{r echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color, fill = cut)) +
  facet_wrap( ~ cut)
```

### facet_grid()

ggplot2 provides two functions for facetting. `facet_grid()` divides the plot into a grid of subplots based on the values of one or two facetting variables. To use it, add `facet_grid()` to the end of your plot call. 

The code chunks below, show three ways to facet with `facet_grid()`. Spot the differences between the chunks, then run the code to learn what the differences do.

```{r facet1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color)) +
  facet_grid(clarity ~ cut)
```

```{r facet2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ cut)
```

```{r facet3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color)) +
  facet_grid(clarity ~ .)
```

### facet_grid() recap

As you saw in the code examples, you use `facet_grid()` by passing it a formula, the names of two variables connected by a `~`. 

`facet_grid()` will split the plot into facets vertically by the values of the first variable: each facet will contain the observations that have a common value of the variable. `facet_grid()` will split the plot horizontally by values of the second variable. The result is a grid of facets, where each specific subplot shows a specific combination of values.

If you do not wish to split on the vertical or horizontal dimension, pass `facet_grid()` a `.` instead of a variable name as a place holder.

### `facet_wrap()`

`facet_wrap()` provides a more relaxed way to facet a plot on a _single_ variable. It will split the plot into subplots and then reorganize the subplots into multiple rows so that each plot has a more or less square aspect ratio. In short, `facet_wrap()` _wraps_ the single row of subplots that you would get with `facet_grid()` into multiple rows. 

To use `facet_wrap()` pass it a single variable name with a `~` before it, e.g. `facet_wrap( ~ color)`.

Add `facet_wrap()` to the code below to create the graph that appeared at the start of this section. Facet on `cut`.

```{r facet4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color, fill = cut))
```

```{r facet4-solution}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color, fill = cut)) +
  facet_wrap( ~ cut)
```

### Joint frequency distribution

The plot

```{r facet5}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = color)) +
  facet_wrap(~ cut)
```

visualizes the joint frequency distribution of `color` and `cut`. As we have used `count()` to compute the marginal frequencies, we can also use it to compute the joint frequencies.


### Exercise 8 - Compute joint frequency distribution.

Use `count()` to compute the joint frequency distribution of `color` and `cut`.

```{r r8, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r r8-solution}
diamonds |> 
  count(color, cut)

```


### Recap

In this tutorial, you learned how to make bar charts; but much of what you learned applies to other types of charts as well. Here's what you should know:

* Bar charts are the basis for histograms, which means that you can interpret histograms in a similar way.
* Bars are not the only geom in ggplot2 that use the fill aesthetic. You can use both fill and color aesthetics with any geom that has an "interior" region.
* You can use the same position adjustments with any ggplot2 geom: `"identity"`, `"stack"`, `"dodge"`, `"fill"`, `"nudge"`, and `"jitter"` (we'll learn about `"nudge"` and `"jitter"` later). Each geom comes with its own sensible default.
* You can facet any ggplot2 plot by adding `facet_grid()` or `facet_wrap()` to the plot call.

Bar charts are an excellent way to display the distribution of a categorical variable. In the next tutorial, we'll meet a set of geoms that display the distribution of a continuous variable.
