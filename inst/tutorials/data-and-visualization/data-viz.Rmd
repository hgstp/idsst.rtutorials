## Welcome

Visualization is one of the most important tools for data science. 

It is also a great way to start learning R; when you visualize data, you get an immediate payoff that will keep you motivated as you learn. After all, learning a new language can be hard!

This tutorial will teach you how to visualize data with R's most popular visualization package, `ggplot2`.

### 

The tutorial focuses on three basic skills:

1. How to create graphs with a reusable **template**.
1. How to add variables to a graph with **aesthetics**.
1. How to make different "types" of graphs with **geoms**.


### 

To visualize data, we must first understand the standard methods of representing data in R. We begin by discussing data frames, specifically the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/)'s reimagining of them, known as [tibbles](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/).

You will explore the popularity of different names over time. To succeed, you will need to master the following tool for manipulating data with R:

* tibbles and `View()`, which let you inspect raw data

We'll use a dataset named `babynames`, which comes in a package that is also named `babynames`. Within `babynames`, you will find information about almost every name given to children in the United States since 1880. 

This tutorial introduces `babynames` and a new data structure that makes working with data in R easy: the tibble.

In addition to `babynames`, this tutorial uses the [core tidyverse packages](http://tidyverse.org/), including ggplot2, tibble, and dplyr. All of these packages have been pre-installed for your convenience. But they haven't been pre-loaded.

## babynames

### Loading babynames

Before we begin, let's learn a little about our data. The `babynames` dataset comes in the **babynames** package. The package is defined as a dependency for `idsst.rtutorials` and was installed together with `idsst.rtutorials`. However, I have not pre-loaded the babynames package, or any other package for this tutorial.

What does this mean? In R, whenever you want to use a package that is not part of base R, you need to load the package with the command `library()`. Until you load a package, R cannot find the datasets and functions contained in the package. For example, if we asked R to display the `babynames` dataset, which comes in the babynames package, right now, we'd get the message below. R cannot find the dataset because we haven't loaded the babynames package.

```{r error = TRUE}
babynames
```

To load the `babynames` package, you would run the command `library(babynames)`. After you load a package, R will be able to find its contents _until you close R_. The next time you open R, you will need to reload the package if you wish to use it again.

This might sound inconvenient, but choosing which packages to load keeps your R experience simple and orderly.

In the chunk below, load babynames (the package) and then open the help page for `babynames` (the data set). Be sure to read the help page before going on.

```{r babynames-1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "bnames"}

```

```{r babynames-1-solution}
library(babynames)
?babynames
```

```{r bnames, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(babynames)
```

### The data

Now that you know a little about the dataset, let's examine its contents. If you were to run `babynames` at your R console, you would get output that looks like this:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
babynames

##  A tibble: 1,924,665 × 5
#     year sex   name          n   prop
#    <dbl> <chr> <chr>     <int>  <dbl>
#  1  1880 F     Mary       7065 0.0724
#  2  1880 F     Anna       2604 0.0267
#  3  1880 F     Emma       2003 0.0205
#  4  1880 F     Elizabeth  1939 0.0199
#  5  1880 F     Minnie     1746 0.0179
#  6  1880 F     Margaret   1578 0.0162
#  7  1880 F     Ida        1472 0.0151
#  8  1880 F     Alice      1414 0.0145
#  9  1880 F     Bertha     1320 0.0135
# 10  1880 F     Sarah      1288 0.0132
##  ℹ 1,924,655 more rows
##  ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows
```



`babynames` is a large dataset, and tibbles are a very good way to store large datasets. R will print only the first ten rows of a tibble and all of the columns that fit into your console window. R also adds valuable summary information about the tibble, such as the data types of each column and the size of the data set. 


The output would have been quite different, if `babynames` would have been a data frame. 

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
babynames

# ...
# 187 1880   F Christina   65 0.00066595
# 188 1880   F     Lelia   65 0.00066595
# 189 1880   F     Nelle   65 0.00066595
# 190 1880   F       Sue   65 0.00066595
# 191 1880   F   Johanna   64 0.00065570
# 192 1880   F     Lilly   64 0.00065570
# 193 1880   F   Lucinda   63 0.00064546
# 194 1880   F   Minerva   63 0.00064546
# 195 1880   F    Lettie   62 0.00063521
# 196 1880   F     Roxie   62 0.00063521
# 197 1880   F   Cynthia   61 0.00062497
# 198 1880   F    Helena   60 0.00061472
# 199 1880   F     Hilda   60 0.00061472
# 200 1880   F     Hulda   60 0.00061472
#  [ reached 'max' / getOption("max.print") -- omitted 1924465 rows ]

```


R shows as many rows as possible before your memory buffer is overwhelmed. At that point, R stops, leaving you to look at an arbitrary section of your data. One can avoid this behavior by transforming data frames into _tibbles_. 


## tibbles

### What is a tibble?

A tibble is a special type of table. R displays tibbles in a refined way whenever you have the **tibble** package loaded. Whenever you do not have the tibble packages loaded, R will display the tibble as a data frame. In fact, tibbles _are_ data frames, an enhanced type of data frame.

You can think of the difference between the data frame display and the tibble display like this:

```{r out.width = "90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tibble_display.png")
```

### as_tibble()

You can transform a data frame to a tibble with the `as_tibble()` function in the tibble package, e.g., `as_tibble(cars)`. However, `babynames` is already a tibble. To display it nicely, you just need to load the tibble package. 

To see what I mean, call `cars` directly and then apply `as_tibble()` to it in the chunk below.

```{r cars, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r cars-solution}
library(tibble)
babynames
```

```{r babynames-3-check}
"Excellent! If you want to check whether or not an object is a tibble, you can use the `is_tibble()` function that comes in the tibble package. For example, this would return TRUE: `is_tibble(babynames)`."
```

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tibble)
```

You do not need to worry much about tibbles in these tutorials; we will automatically convert each data frame into an interactive table in future tutorials. However, you should consider making tibbles an important part of your work in R.

### View()

What if you'd like to inspect the remaining portions of a tibble? To see the entire tibble, use the `View()` command. R will launch a window that shows a scrollable display of the entire data set. For example, the code below will launch a data viewer in the RStudio IDE.

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
View(babynames)
```

`View()` works in conjunction with the software (like RStudio) you run R from: `View()` opens the data editor provided by that software. Unfortunately, this tutorial doesn't come with a data editor, so you won't be able to use `View()` today (unless you open the RStudio IDE, for example, and run the code there).

### Recap

Tibbles are a tool that makes life with R easier. Ironically, you may not immediately appreciate their value: these tutorials wrap data frames into an interactive table for display. However, you will want to utilize tibbles and the tidyverse package when you move out of the tutorials and begin working with R inside the RStudio IDE.

This tutorial also introduced the babynames dataset. In the tutorials on data wrangling, you will use this data set to plot the popularity of names over time. Along the way, you will learn how to filter and subset data sets in R.


## ggplot2 basics


Let's begin with a question to explore.


> What do you think: 
         Do cars with larger engines consume more fuel than cars with smaller engines?



### `mpg`

You can test your hypothesis with the `mpg` dataset from the `ggplot2` package. `mpg` contains observations collected on 38 models of cars by the US Environmental Protection Agency. 

To see the `mpg` data frame, type `mpg` in the code block below and click "Submit Answer".

```{r mpg0, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r mpg0-solution}
mpg
```

```{r mpg0-check}
"Good job! We'll use interactive code chunks like this throughout these tutorials. Whenever you encounter one, you can click Submit Answer to run (or re-run) the code in the chunk. If there is a Solution button, you can click it to see the answer."
```

You can use the black triangle that appears at the top right of the table to scroll through all of the columns in `mpg`.

### 

Among the variables in `mpg` are:

1. `displ`, a car's engine size, in liters.
1. `hwy`, a car's fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg). A car with a low mpg consumes more fuel than a car with a high mpg when they travel the same distance.

Now let's use this data to make our first graph.

### A plot

The code below uses functions from the **ggplot2** package to plot the relationship between `displ` and `hwy`. 

To see the plot, click "Run Code."

```{r ggplot1, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

Can you spot the relationship?

### And the answer is...

The plot shows a negative relationship between engine size (`displ`) and fuel efficiency (`hwy`). 
Points with a large value of `displ` tend to have a small value of `hwy`, and vice versa.

In other words, cars with big engines use _more_ fuel. If that was your hypothesis, you were right!

Now let's look at how we made the plot.

### `ggplot()`

Here's the code that we used to make the plot. Notice that it contains three functions: `ggplot()`, `geom_point()`, and `aes()`.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

In R, a function is a name followed by a set of __round__ brackets. Many functions require special information to do their jobs, and you write this information between the brackets.

### `ggplot`

The first function, `ggplot()`, creates a coordinate system that you can add layers to. The first argument of `ggplot()` is the dataset to use in the graph. 

By itself, `ggplot(data = mpg)` creates an empty graph, which looks like this. 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg)
```

### geom_point()

`geom_point()` adds a layer of points to the empty plot created by `ggplot()`, resulting in a scatterplot.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

### mapping = aes()

`geom_point()` takes a `mapping` argument that defines which variables in your dataset are mapped to which aesthetic attributes of your plot. In the previous example, it was specified which variables are assigned to the axes of your graph.  The variable `displ` was mapped to the `x` aesthetic and `hwy` to the `y` aesthetic of the graph. The value of the `mapping` argument is always defined using the `aes()` function, which allows you to consolidate all the mappings you wish to create.

### 

Here, we want to map the `displ` variable to the x-axis and the `hwy` variable to the y-axis, so we add `x = displ` and `y = hwy` inside of `aes()` (and we separate them with a comma). 

Where will ggplot2 look for these mapped variables? In the data frame that we passed to the `data` argument, in this case, `mpg`.

### A graphing workflow

Our code follows the common workflow for making graphs with ggplot2. To make a graph, you: 

1. Start the graph with `ggplot()`.
1. Add elements to the graph with a `geom_` function.
1. Select variables with the `mapping = aes()` argument to specify aesthetic attributes of the graph.

### A graphing template

In fact, you can turn our code into a reusable template for making graphs. To make a graph, replace in the code below

- `<DATA>` with a data set, 
- `<GEOM_FUNCTION>` with a `geom_` function, and
- `<MAPPINGS>` with a collection of mappings.

Give it a try! Replace the bracketed sections with `mpg`, `geom_boxplot`, and `x = class, y = hwy` to make a slightly different graph. Be sure to delete the `#` symbols before you run the code.

```{r template, exercise = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
#  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```

```{r template-solution}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy))
```

```{r template-check}
"Good job! This plot uses boxplots to compare the fuel efficiencies of different types of cars. ggplot2 comes with many geom functions that each add a different type of layer to a plot. You'll learn more about boxplots (and other geoms) in the following tutorials and when we speak about exploring numerical data."
```

### Common problems

As you start writing R code, you'll likely run into problems. 
Don't worry; it happens to everyone. Even after writing R code for years, one still writes code that doesn't work on a regular basis! 

Start by comparing your code to the code in the examples. R is extremely picky, and a misplaced character can make all the difference. 

> Ensure that every `(` is matched with a `)` and every `"` is paired with another `"`. Also, pay attention to capitalization; R is case-sensitive.

### + location

One common problem when creating ggplot2 graphics is to put the `+` in the wrong place: it has to come at the end of a line, not the start. In other words, make sure you haven't accidentally written code like this:

```R
ggplot(data = mpg) 
+ geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

### help

If you're still stuck, try the help. You can get help about any R function by running `?function_name` in a code chunk, e.g. `?geom_point`. 
Don't worry if the help doesn't seem that helpful. Instead, scroll to the bottom of the help page and take a look at the given code examples. Try to find an example that matches what you're trying to do.

If that doesn’t resolve the issue, take a close look at the error message that appears when you run your (non-working) code. Often, the solution can be found within the message itself. However, if you’re new to R, you may not yet know how to interpret the error. Another useful resource is Google: try searching for the error message, as someone else may have encountered the same problem and found a solution online.

### Exercise 1

Run `ggplot(data = mpg)` what do you see?

```{r blank, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r blank-check}
"Good job! A ggplot that has no layers looks blank. To finish the graph, add a geom function."
```
     
### Exercise 2 

Make a scatterplot of `cty` vs `hwy`.

```{r scatterplot, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r scatterplot-check}
"Excellent work!"
```

```{r scatterplot-hint}
"Scatterplots are also called points plots and bubble plots. They use the point geom."
```

### Exercise 3  

What happens if you make a scatterplot of `class` vs `drv`. Try it. Why is the plot not useful?
    
```{r scatterplot2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r scatterplot2-check}
"Nice job! `class` and `drv` are both categorical variables. As a result, points can only appear at certain values. Hence, many points may overlap each other. You have no idea how many points fall on top of each other at each location. Experiment with geom_count() to find a better solution."
```


## Aesthetic mappings

> "The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we
> never expected to see." --- John Tukey


### A closer look

In the plot below, a group of points (highlighted in red) appears to deviate from the linear trend between engine size and gas mileage. These cars show lower gas mileage than one might expect based on their engine size. What common characteristics, if any, do these observations share?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_point(data = dplyr::filter(mpg, displ > 5, hwy > 20), colour = "red", size = 2.2)
```

### A hypothesis

Let's hypothesize that the cars are hybrids. One way to test this hypothesis is to look at each car's `class` value. The `class` variable of the `mpg` dataset classifies cars into groups such as compact, midsize, and SUV. If the outlying points are hybrids, they should be classified as compact cars or, perhaps, subcompact cars (keep in mind that this data was collected before hybrid trucks and SUVs became popular). To check this, we need to add the `class` variable to the plot.

### Aesthetics

You can add a third variable, like `class`, to a two dimensional scatterplot by mapping it to a new __aesthetic__. An aesthetic is a visual property of the objects in your plot. Aesthetics include things like the size, the shape, or the color of your points. 

You can display a point (like the one below) in different ways by changing the values of its aesthetic properties. Since we already use the word "value" to describe data, let's use the word "level" to describe aesthetic properties. Here, we change the levels of a point's size, shape, and color to make the point small, triangular, or blue:

```{r, echo = FALSE, asp = 1/4, out.width = "100%"}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(1, 1), size = 20) +
  geom_point(aes(2, 1), size = 10) + 
  geom_point(aes(3, 1), size = 20, shape = 17) + 
  geom_point(aes(4, 1), size = 20, colour = "blue") + 
  scale_x_continuous(NULL, limits = c(0.5, 4.5), labels = NULL) + 
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, limits = c(0.9, 1.1), labels = NULL) + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1/3)
```

### A strategy

We can add the `class` variable to the plot by mapping the different values of `class` to different levels of an aesthetic (like color). For example, we can color a point green if it belongs to the compact class, blue if it belongs to the midsize class, and so on. 

Let's give this a try. Fill in the blank piece of code below with `color = class`. What happens? Delete the commenting symbols (`#`) before running your code. (If you prefer British English, use `colour` instead of `color`.)

```{r aesthetics, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# ggplot(data = mpg) + 
#   geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, ____________))
```

<div id="aesthetics-hint">
**Hint:** Be sure to remove all of the underlines and hashtags from the code.
</div>

```{r aesthetics-solution}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```

```{r aesthetics-check}
"Great Job! You can now tell which class of car each point represents by examining the color of the point."
```

### And the answer is...

The colors indicate that many of the unusual points in the `mpg` data correspond to two-seater cars. These vehicles appear not to be hybrids; rather, they are sports cars. Sports cars typically have large engines similar to those found in SUVs and pickup trucks, but their bodies are smaller, comparable to midsize and compact cars. This design improves their gas mileage. In retrospect, it makes sense that these cars are unlikely to be hybrids, given their large engines.

This isn't the only insight we've gleaned; you've also learned how to add new aesthetics to your graph. Let's review the process.

### Aesthetic mappings

To map a variable to an aesthetic, set the name of the aesthetic equal to the name of the variable, and do this inside `mapping = aes()`. ggplot2 will automatically assign a unique level of the aesthetic (here a unique color) to each unique value of the variable. ggplot2 will also add a legend that explains which levels correspond to which values.


### Other aesthetics

In the above example, we mapped `class` to color, but we could have mapped `class` to size in the same way. 

Change the code below to map  `class` to size. What happens? 

```{r size, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```

<div id="size-hint">
**Hint:** If `color` controls the _color_ aesthetic, what word do you suppose controls the _size_ aesthetic?
</div>

```{r size-solution}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = class))
```

```{r size-check}
"Great Job! Now the size of a point represents its class. Did you notice the warning message? ggplot2 gives us a warning here because mapping an unordered variable (class) to an ordered aesthetic (size) is not a good idea."
```

### Alpha

You can also map `class` to the alpha aesthetic to control the transparency of the points. Try it below.

```{r alpha, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

<div id="alpha-hint">
**Hint:** If `color` controls the _color_ aesthetic, what word do you suppose controls the _alpha_ aesthetic?
</div>

```{r alpha-solution}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, alpha = class))
```

```{r alpha-check}
"Great Job! If you look closely, you can notice a subtle detail: many locations have multiple points layered over each other (since alpha is additive, multiple transparent points may appear opaque)."
```

### Shape

Let's try one more aesthetic. This time map `class` to the `shape` aesthetic, then look for the SUVs. What happened?

```{r shape, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

<div id="shape-hint">
**Hint:** If `color` controls the _color_ aesthetic, what word do you suppose controls the _shape_ aesthetic?
</div>

```{r shape-solution}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))
```

```{r shape-check}
"Good work! What happened to the SUVs? ggplot2 will only use six shapes at a time. By default, additional groups will go unplotted when you use the shape aesthetic. So only use it when you have fewer than seven groups."
```

### Exercise 4

In the code below, map `cty`, a continuous variable, to _color_, _size_, and _shape_. How do these aesthetics behave differently for continuous variables, like `cty`, vs. categorical variables, like `class`? 

```{r cty, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
# Map cty to color
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

# Map cty to size
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

# Map cty to shape
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

```{r cty-check}
"Very nice! ggplot2 treats continuous and categorical variables differently. Noteably, ggplot2 supplies a blue gradient when you map a continuous variable to color, and ggplot2 will not map continuous variables to shape."
```
    
### Exercise 5

Map `class` to _color_, _size_, and _shape_ all in the same plot. Does it work?

```{r multiple, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

```{r multiple-check}
"Very nice! ggplot2 can map the same variable to multiple aesthetics."
```
    
<div id="multiple-hint">
**Hint:** Be sure to set each mapping separately, e.g. `color = class`, `size = class`, etc.
</div>    
    
### Exercise 6

What happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like `aes(colour = displ < 5)`?  Try it.
    
```{r nonvar, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

```{r nonvar-check}
"Good job! ggplot2 will map the aesthetic to the results of the expression. Here, ggplot2 mapped a variable with values TRUE or FALSE, based on whether the point's `displ` value was less than five or not, to the color aesthetic."
```

### Setting aesthetics

What if you just want to make all of the points in your plot blue, like in the plot below?

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
ggplot(mpg) +
  geom_point(aes(displ, hwy), color = "blue")
```

You can do this by setting the color aesthetic _outside_ of the `aes()` function, like this

```{r setting, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
```

### Mapping vs. Setting

Each aesthetic in ggplot2 can have its value defined through specific settings. To manually assign an aesthetic to a specific value in the visual space, set the aesthetic outside of `aes()`.

```{r setting2, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue", shape = 3, alpha = 0.5)
```

If you want to map the a **variable** from the data space to an aesthetic, define the mapping inside `aes()`.

```{r setting3, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class, shape = fl, alpha = displ))
```

### Exercise 7

What do you think went wrong in the code below? Fix the code so it does something sensible.

```{r e4, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue"))
```

```{r e4-solution}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")

"Good job! Putting an aesthetic in the wrong location is one of the most common graphing errors. Sometimes it helps to think of legends. If you will need a legend to understand what the color/shape/etc. means, then you should probably put the aesthetic inside `aes()` --- ggplot2 will build a legend for every aesthetic mapped here. If the aesthetic has no meaning and is just... well, aesthetic, then set it outside of `aes()`."
```


### Recap

For each aesthetic, you associate the name of the aesthetic with a variable to display, and you 
do this within `aes()`. 

Once you map a variable to an aesthetic, ggplot2 takes care of the rest. It selects a reasonable scale to use with the aesthetic and constructs a legend explaining the mapping between the 
values of the variable and the different levels of the aesthetic. For x and y aesthetics, ggplot2 does not create a legend but creates an axis line with tick marks and a label. The axis line acts as a legend; it explains the mapping between locations and values.

You've experimented with the most common aesthetics for points: `x`, `y`, `color`, `size`, `alpha` and `shape`. Each geom uses its own set of aesthetics; for instance, a line wouldn't have a shape. To find out which aesthetics a geom uses, open its help page, e.g., `?geom_line`.

This brings up a new question that we have only briefly touched upon: 

> What is a geom?

## Geometric objects

### Geoms

How are these two plots similar? 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align="default", message = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

Both plots contain the same x variable and y variable, describing the same data. But the plots are not identical. Each plot uses a different visual object to represent the data. In ggplot2 syntax, we say they use different __geoms__.

A __geom__ is the geometrical object that a plot uses to represent observations. People often describe plots by the type of geom that the plot uses. For example, bar charts use bar geoms, line charts use line geoms, boxplots use boxplot geoms, and so on.


As we see above, you can use different geoms to plot the same data. The plot on the left uses the point geom, and the plot on the right uses the smooth geom, a smooth line fitted to the data. 

### Geom functions

To change the geom in your plot, change the geom function that you add to `ggplot()`. For example, take this code which makes the plot on the left (above), and change `geom_point()` to `geom_smooth()`. What do you get? 

```{r geom, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

```{r geom-solution}
# right
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

```{r geom-check}
"Good job! You get the plot on the right (above)."
```

### More about geoms

ggplot2 provides over 30 geom functions that you can use to make plots, and [extension packages](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/) provide even more. You'll learn how to use different geoms to explore data in the chapter on exploring data and the following tutorials.

Until then, the best way to get a comprehensive overview of the available geoms is to visit the [ggplot2 website](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#geoms). To learn more about any geom, look at its help page, e.g., `?geom_smooth`.

### Putting it all together

The ideas that you've learned here: geoms, aesthetics, and the implied existence of a data space and a visual space combine to form a system known as the Grammar of Graphics.

The Grammar of Graphics provides a systematic way to build any graph and underlies the ggplot2 package. In fact, the first two letters of ggplot2 stand for "Grammar of Graphics".

### Where to from here

Congratulations! You can use the ggplot2 code template to plot any dataset in many different ways. As you begin exploring data, you should incorporate these tools into your workflow.

Your new data visualization skills will make it easier to learn other parts of R, because you can now visualize the results of any change that you make to data. You'll put these skills to immediate use in upcoming tutorials, which will show you how to extract values from datasets, as well as how to compute new variables and summary statistics from your data. See you there.
